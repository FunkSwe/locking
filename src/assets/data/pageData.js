    desc: 'James "Skeeter Rabbit" Higgins is a legendary figure in street dance, particularly known for his contributions to Locking. Raised in South Central Los Angeles, he was an original Soul Train dancer (1972-1975) and a member of the pioneering crew, the Original Go-Go Brothers. His nickname, "Skeeter Rabbit," inspired the signature "Skeeter Rabbit" step—a hop and shuffle that’s central to Locking routines.\n\nSkeeter´s influence shaped the early street dance scene in Southern California, performing with groups like 33 RPM and Go-Go Brothers, sharing Locking`s energetic style across California. In 1972, he joined the first unisex Locking group, formed by the Watts Writers Workshop, alongside iconic dancers who helped elevate Locking’s art form.\n\nThough later pursuing a career in law enforcement, Skeeter remained dedicated to dance, teaching globally, judging competitions, and co-creating LockingLegends.net to preserve the dance`s history. Today, he’s celebrated as an OG of Locking, inspiring dancers worldwide and emphasizing the cultural importance of street dance.',
